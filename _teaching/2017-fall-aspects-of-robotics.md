This course is an overview of the field of robotics. The intent of this course is to give students an in depth understanding of how robots work, and the application and use of computers to typical robotic problems. Students will also be exposed to current research directions in robotics. The course will cover the essentials of programming and interacting with robots, and we will be using the GoPiGo mobile robot platform for hands-on experience with robots.
