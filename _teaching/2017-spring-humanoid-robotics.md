This course is a seminar course on the field of Humanoid Robots. Humanoid robots have finally achieved critical mass as the hardware technology has reached the point where practical and useful humanoids now exist. Adding sensing, perception and cognition to these platforms is a challenging and exciting problem which we will explore during the semester.
