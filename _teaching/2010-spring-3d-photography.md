The ability to acquire, view, animate, and analyze 3D objects in a computer is becoming increasingly important. When we see 3D objects in a computer, we need to ask the question "how did they get in there?". There are many different methods and approaches to answering this question. The methods differ depending on size (how do you acquire and model a molecular structure, an anatomical part of the body, a person, a machine, a building...?) and function of the model (model's that need to be viewed only do not have to be geometrically or topologically correct; models that are used for physical analysis or simulation may need to be). This course will explore 3D Photography - the process of automatically creating 3D texture mapped models of objects -in detail. Applications of this technology include robotics, medicine, graphics, Virtual Reality, entertainment, digital movies etc. We will discuss 3D data acquisition devices, 3D modeling systems, and methods to acquire, create, augment, manipulate render, animate and physically build such models.
