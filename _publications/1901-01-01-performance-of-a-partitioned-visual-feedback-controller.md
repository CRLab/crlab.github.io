We present a novel approach we call partitioning where the robot&apos;s degrees-of-freedom (DOF) are categorized into two classes based on joint kinematics and dynamics to design a coupled multi-input control system. We use image data to visually servo the first class of joints that have quick response time. Position-based data is used to kinematically servo the second class of joints that have large kinematic range. The net effect is an active-vision system that synergistically tracks a diverse range of targets (without using CAD-based models) over a wide bandwidth of motion dynamics.
