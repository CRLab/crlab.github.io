Most robotic hands are either sensorless or lack the ability to report accurate position and force information relating to contact. This paper describes a robotic hand system that uses a limited set of native joint position and force sensing along with custom designed tactile sensors and real-time vision modules to accurately compute finger contacts and applied forces for grasping tasks. A number of experiments are described that show how these sensors can be combined to increase the capabilities of a robotic hand for grasping and manipulation tasks. 1
