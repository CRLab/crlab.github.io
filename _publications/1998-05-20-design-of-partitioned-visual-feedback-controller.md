Image-based servoing systems are often used to track moving targets and their underlying control architecture is a regulation of the image. This regulation is a function of rigid camera-to-target geometric constraints. Satisfying such constraints requires that the robot motors have sufficient velocity bandwidths, and often these bandwidths are limited. This paper lays down the foundation for a partitioned controller. Such a controller would coordinate a camera&apos;s DOF into a synergistic move to overcome bandwidth limitations. Tracking experiments are shown on a custom designed 5-DOF gantry robot which highlight the limitations of regulator-based control, as well as show how partitioning can be used to achieve more robust control.
