Previous grasp quality research is mainly theoretical, and has assumed that contact types and positions are given, in order to preserve the generality of the proposed quality measures. The example results provided by these works either ignore hand geometry and kinematics entirely or involve only the simplest of grippers. We present a unique grasp analysis system that, when given a 3D object, hand, and pose for the hand, can accurately determine the types of contacts that will occur between the links of the hand and the object, and compute two measures of quality for the grasp. Using models of two articulated robotic hands, we analyze several grasps of a polyhedral model of a telephone handset, and we use a novel technique to visualize the 6D space used in these computations. In addition, we demonstrate the possibility of using this system for synthesizing high quality grasps by performing a search over a subset of possible hand configurations.
