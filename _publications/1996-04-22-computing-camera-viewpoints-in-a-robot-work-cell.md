Automatically planning a camera viewpoint for tasks such as inspection in an active robot work-cell is a difficult problem. This paper discusses new methods for computing viewpoints which meet the feature detectability constraints of focus, field-of-view, visibility, and resolution. A theoretical outline of the method is presented, followed by experimental results and a discussion of future work.
